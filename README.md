# LLMSDN
The MRSCO framework optimizes SDN routing by leveraging LLMs and P4 programmability. LLMs analyze real-time network telemetry to generate adaptive routing rules, which P4 switches enforce for fine-grained control. This approach ensures dynamic policy updates, congestion mitigation, and multi-constraint optimization, efficiency in SDN networks.
